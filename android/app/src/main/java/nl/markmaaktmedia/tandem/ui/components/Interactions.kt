/**
 * A tap that answers back.
 *
 * The element dips under the finger and springs out again with a touch of overshoot,
 * which is what makes a flat rectangle feel like something that was actually pressed.
 * The scale runs on a spring rather than a tween on purpose: a spring keeps its
 * momentum when the finger lifts mid-animation, so a quick tap and a slow press both
 * look right instead of only the one that was designed for.
 *
 * The ripple stays. It is what tells you where the touch landed, and losing it for
 * the sake of the scale would trade information for polish. It covers the element at its
 * full size while the content dips, so a row in a slab is lit edge to edge.
