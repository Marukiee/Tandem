/**
 * The moving pill behind the navigation bar and the segmented control.
 *
 * It is two edges, not one box. Each edge is its own spring, and the edge in the
 * direction of travel gets the stiffer one, so it leaps ahead and the other edge
 * follows: the pill stretches on the way out and pulls itself back together on
 * arrival. Width is simply right minus left.
 *
 * The earlier version scaled a fixed box by "distance still to go". That value jumps
 * from zero to its maximum on the first frame of a move, so the pill visibly snapped
 * wider before it began to travel. Here nothing is derived from a target, both edges
 * start where they are and the stretch is only ever the difference between two
 * springs, so it grows from nothing.
 *
 * Retargeting in the middle of a move is safe for the same reason: an [Animatable]
 * keeps its velocity, so a second tap bends the motion instead of restarting it.
