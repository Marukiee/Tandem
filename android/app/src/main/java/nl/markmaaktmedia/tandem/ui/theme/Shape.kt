 * A squircle with continuous corners, the kind where the curve blends into the
 * straight edge instead of meeting it.
 *
 * A plain rounded rectangle has a visible seam at each corner: the arc stops and the
 * line starts, and at the 28dp radius this app uses everywhere that seam is easy to
 * see. This draws the corner as a pair of cubics whose control points run along the
 * edges, so curvature ramps up rather than switching on. It is the difference
 * between a card that looks drawn and one that looks moulded.
 *
 * The corner is capped at 40 percent of the shorter side, because past that the
 * control points cross and the shape folds in on itself.
